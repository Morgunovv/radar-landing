          "howItWorks": {
            "question": "How does channel monitoring work?",
            "answer": "How it works:\n1. Bot connects to Telegram via API\n2. Tracks new messages in specified channels\n3. Checks messages for keyword matches (if configured)\n4. Adds matching messages to publication queue\n5. Publishes messages to specified publication channels\n\nTechnical details:\n• Public channels use a shared monitoring account\n• Private channels require personal account connection\n• Messages are processed asynchronously via Redis queue\n• Delay between message processing is minimal"
          },
          "channelsLimit": {
            "question": "How many channels can I monitor?",
            "answer": "Plan limits:\n• Free: up to 5 monitoring channels, up to 10 keyword queries\n• Light: up to 50 channels, up to 50 keyword queries\n• Medium: up to 100 channels, up to 100 keyword queries\n• Hard: up to 200 channels, up to 200 keyword queries\n• Rock: up to 500 channels, up to 200 keyword queries\n\nWhat counts:\n• Monitoring channels (where messages come from)\n• Publication channels (where messages are published)\n• Total = monitoring channels + publication channels"

          "privateChannels": {
            "question": "Can I monitor private channels?",
            "answer": "Yes, with conditions:\n• Requires personal Telegram account connection\n• Requires paid plan (Light, Medium, Hard, Rock)\n• Need access to channel (subscription or invite link)\n\nHow to add private channel:\n1. Connect personal account\n2. Get invite link to channel\n3. Send invite link to bot\n4. Bot will automatically subscribe to channel via your account\n\nLimitations:\n• Private channels can only be monitored via personal account\n• Free plan does not support private channels\n• Channel notifications are automatically disabled"
          },
          "speed": {
            "question": "How fast do messages arrive after publication?",
            "answer": "Processing speed:\n• Usually messages are published within seconds after appearing in source channel\n• Delay depends on server load and task queue\n• Average: 5-30 seconds\n\nFactors affecting speed:\n• Number of messages being processed\n• Server load\n• Telegram API delays\n• Number of monitoring channels"

If no matches - message is not published\n\nFeatures:\n• Search is case-insensitive (by default)\n• Partial word search\n• Search through entire message text\n\nExample:\nKeyword: \"bitcoin\"\nMessage: \"Bitcoin reached new maximum\"\nResult: ✅ Match found"
