Adds matching messages to publication queue\n5. Publishes messages to specified publication channels\n\nTechnical details:\n• Public channels use a shared monitoring account\n• Private channels require personal account connection\n• Messages are processed asynchronously via Redis queue\n• Delay between message processing is minimal"

Connect personal account\n2. Get invite link to channel\n3. Send invite link to bot\n4. Bot will automatically subscribe to channel via your account\n\nLimitations:\n• Private channels can only be monitored via personal account\n• Free plan does not support private channels\n• Channel notifications are automatically disabled"
