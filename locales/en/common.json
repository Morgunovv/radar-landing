Adds matching messages to publication queue\n5. Publishes messages to specified publication channels\n\nTechnical details:\n• Public channels use a shared monitoring account\n• Private channels require personal account connection\n• Messages are processed asynchronously via Redis queue\n• Delay between message processing is minimal"
